# Terraform

This project is for all the terraform modules created for Azure cloud infrastructure for my personal testing.

The terraform azure provider "https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html" gives us with a extensive list of resource and data modules for terraform use.

There will be cases where we may need to build a customised infrastructure but these modules may not be available over here.

Hence customised modules which i will be building i will be sharing over here so that it can be helpful to any one .

Happy to receive any contributions which can make the module more efficient and robust as well
